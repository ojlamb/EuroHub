  <h1>Global Capital</h1>

  <p>Global Capital is a leading news, opinion and data service for people and institutions using and working in the international capital markets. It provides you with clearly-voiced, lively coverage of key markets based on the comments of those who work in them, together with a wealth of transaction data and archive material.  Whether you wish to pick up the pulse of your market, to research in detail an issuer, intermediary or asset class in a particular sector, or to check out how your institution is performing relative to its peers, our service is for you.</p>

  <p>GlobalCapital descends directly from EuroWeek (“the voice of the markets”), which has been covering new issues in primary markets for 26 years.  Joining the platform are also several key capital markets publications from the Euromoney Institutional Investor Group: Asiamoney, Total Securitization and Derivatives Week.  GlobalCapital also sees the introduction of a brand new service on the internationalisation of the RMB.</p>

  <p>The combination of these elements on state-of-the-art new web technology provides a device-neutral, flexible global news and data service where relevant related articles and data are a click away.</p>
