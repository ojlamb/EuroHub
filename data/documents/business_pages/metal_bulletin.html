  <h1>Metal Bulletin</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Metal Bulletin was first introduced in 1913. Its mission then, as it is now, was to provide must-have timely information, including price indications, for the global non-ferrous metals and steel markets. Over the years, Metal Bulletin became established as the bible for the world's metals and steel trading communities.</p>

  <p>The magazine is published weeklyâ€”with a news and prices website with breaking news alerts, daily email news round-ups, as well as the option of online real-time prices.</p>

  <p>Metal Bulletin's breadth of product offerings extends from online news and prices services, magazines, newsletters and online real time services, to directories and databases, books, market trackers and forecasts, research reports, and consultancy and the staging of events around the globe in the form of conferences and exhibitions.</p>
